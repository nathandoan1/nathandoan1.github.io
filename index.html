        <p>We want to include a small image like the information icon to the left. Our goal is to have the text wrap around it so the image is integrated into the page. In particular, we will have at least one relatively small image float left or right. To achieve your goal, wrap it in a figure element with a class called left. Include a figcaption element. This involves putting together about four lines of code. Examples of the four lines are present in the links found in this outline of the code I want you to write.We want to include a small image like the information icon to the left.
