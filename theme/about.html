            Hi, my name is Nathan Doan and I'm currently a running start student as a senior. Being able to program and
            code has been something I've been interested in and so I want to see where it can take me. I have no
            experience in coding so I'm taking this class to see if I want to continue to pursue this path.

            During my free time I tend to browse the internet and different media sources.
        </p>
