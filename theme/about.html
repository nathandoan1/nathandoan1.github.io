        <p> Hi, my name is Nathan Doan and I'm currently a running start student as a senior. The high school I'm originally from is Skyline High School. Being able to program and
            code has been something I've been interested in and so I want to see where it can take me. I have no experience in coding so I'm taking this class to see if I want to continue to pursue this path. I'm hoping that coding will stick onto me and I may continue this as a potential carrer. The world has adapted to having technology present almost 24/7 in our lives and learning to code may help me with surviving in this large industry of tech.
        </p>

        <p>I've lived my entire life here in Washington. I was born in Seattle but then moved to Sammamish when I was about 3 years old. I have two brothers, one older and one younger.Many of my hobbies include browsing the internet, listening to music, and playing games.</p>
