        <p>The lore (story) behind this video game is fairly extensive and if I were to talk about all of it, I'd most likely not be able to go over all of it, nor be able to fit it within the page limit. Instead I'll be focusing on the story of a certain character named "Master Chief" (or John). As I've said before, there's plenty of story in this game series, so I'm starting with the basics of this universe. <a href="#pic1">Picture of costume of main charcter.</a></p>
    
        <p>In order to understand who this character is, I have to explain the general idea of the game. The year is around 2550 and the main conflict is between humans and an alien race called the "Covenant". Humans have colonized around most of the universe in order to expand out and explore. But scattered throughout the universe are essentially floating galaxy ending weapons the size of planets which both races call rings. You could think of them as mini Death Star's but they shoot out energy enough to blow up a galaxy. The Covenant wish to seek these in order to fullfil their prophecy of enlightment.<strong>To put it in short, the Covenant want to fire the rings for their religion and the humans want to stop them or else they'll destroy the universe.</strong> <a href="#pic2">A picture to scale the size of these. (Galaxy in background, not bigger than it).</a></p>

         <p>To counteract the Covenant the humans created an undercover program to genetically enhance humans. After research they found that children are the best for enhancing them. These children would then grow up with these enhancements and would be stronger than your average human, enough to so to take on army of these aliens by themselves. They would be put into a suit of armor and they called them "spartans". The experiment itself never harmed anyone, but they did take in orphaned children as they had nowhere else to go. These spartans would then be enlisted into the military called the UNSC (United Nations Space Command). Our main character was a part of these experiments and was considered the best result of them, easily outperforming the others in terms of combat. As far as basics goes, John is our main protagonist and his story follows how he saves humanity.</p>

        <p>I call them basics but there is a good amount of information before you're able to grasp what the universe holds. The first game starts with John being in a ship floating towards a ring in space. The humans already know of what the rings are capable of so they decide to go shut down the ring. Upon landing they find that the Covenant are already on the ring and are setting up for activating the ring. The crew push through the ring and dispose of any Covenant along the way. In order to find the central room -which is the area to activate the ring- they must find a cartographer to guide them. After reaching the central room, they decide to blow it up. Along with blowing up the room, the ring destabalizes and shuts down entirely. John makes a run for a different ship and flies away from the ring. This is just the first game put into a very broad summary of what happens.</p>

        <p>The game franchise continues the story of John and his different adventures. Overall, the game is based on a Sci-Fi shooter where you play a super soldier and defend humanity from its destruction.</p>
