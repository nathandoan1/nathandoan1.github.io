    <p>My experience with the game itself is somewhat personal. Growing up playing games, this is the one game I always went to when I was bored. This is a game that I hold very close in my heart, as a kid I wouldn't play anything else but games related to the Halo franchise. Due to all of this I managed to grow in an interest in video games and it has become one of my main hobbies. As I grew older I continued to learn more about this series and went into extensive research into the different stories in this universe just because I was so interested. This series is definetly something I treasure and going back and playing the older games is alwyas a great experience for me. Not only that, but it help me develop relationships with others. I'd talk to otherss that also share an interest in this along with playing with people online and creating friendships. Not just online but locally as well, people I'd know would come over to my house just to play Halo and have fun playing.</p>
