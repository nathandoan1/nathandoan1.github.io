    <p>The company that originally owned the Halo franchise was called Bungie. They were a small ambitious company who revolutionized how controllers work. Before, controllers were very weird in how they worked, only utilizing one joystick for most of the movements. What Bungie did was make Halo, the first FPS to ustilize both joysticks for moving in the game. The company itself was actually created in Bellevue, Washington, meaning it was a local project here. Along with revolutionizing the concept of how controllers worked, the first Halo game was very popular and people loved it, being an FPS on a console they can play. Bungie also had the idea of local play, meaning if you had multiple controllers for one console, you and some other people could play together on the same console rather than having multiple. 
    <p>After 10 years they dropped the Halo series and went on to make other games, a popular one being Destiny. Microsoft took the rights of the Halo series and started to make their own games still following the story of Master Chief.</p>
