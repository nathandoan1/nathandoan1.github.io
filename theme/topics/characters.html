        <h2>Master Chief (John)</h2>
        <p>Master Chief is the main protagonist in the Halo series. Being a spartan he has saved countless lives and is considered one of the best soldier in the UNSC (United Nations Space Command). Being a part of the war for most of his life, he is very seasonsed and is often cold to others. Although he is cold he does care for others safety more than anything. Along with this attitude he is typically very quiet and likes to work alone. He can be described as a lone wolf, almost seeing others as potentially in the way.</p>
