    <p>Halo 1 was made in 2001. The game featured many things such as local play and would eventually go into online play. This original game sparked a new fire in the company, as the game was very successful. Many people started getting into the FPS (First person shooter) genre and started to love the idea of it. After a few more years Halo 2 was published in 2004. People would be scattering and running to buy this new game Bungie released due to the popularity of Halo 1. As usual the game was successful and introduced online play, meaning you could play with complete strangers from across the country. I could go on about the other games, but the devlopment of this series grew out extremely well. It would create communities and tournaments of different players just because of one game.</p>
